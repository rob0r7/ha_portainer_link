# HA Portainer Link

A comprehensive Home Assistant integration for managing Docker containers and stacks through Portainer.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Container Management**: Start, stop, and restart individual containers
- **Stack Management**: Control entire Docker stacks (start, stop, update)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status, CPU, memory, and uptime tracking
- **Automatic Discovery**: Automatically detects containers and stacks
- **SSL Support**: Automatic SSL certificate handling with fallback

### Integration Modes
- **Lightweight View**: Essential features only (switches, restart buttons, basic sensors)
- **Full View**: Complete functionality including update checks and version sensors

### Device Organization
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Organized by stacks and containers
- **Smart Grouping**: Automatic stack detection and container grouping
- **Clean UI**: Clear separation between container and stack controls

## 📋 Requirements

- Home Assistant 2023.8.0 or newer
- Portainer CE/EE with API access
- Network connectivity between Home Assistant and Portainer

## 🔧 Installation

### Option 1: HACS (Recommended)
1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) if you haven't already
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
3. Search for "HA Portainer Link" and install it
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Option 2: Manual Installation
1. Download the `custom_components/ha_portainer_link` folder
2. Copy it to your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Initial Setup
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "HA Portainer Link"
4. Enter your Portainer details:
   - **Portainer URL**: Full URL (e.g., `https://192.168.1.100:9443`)
   - **Username/Password** or **API Key**: Your Portainer credentials
   - **Endpoint ID**: **Important!** Check your Portainer URL - if you see `https://192.168.1.100:9443/#!/1/docker/containers` then your endpoint ID is `1`. If you see `#!/2/docker/containers` then it's `2`, etc.
   - **Integration Mode**: Choose Lightweight or Full View

**💡 Pro Tip**: Look at your Portainer URL when you're viewing containers. The number after `#!/` is your endpoint ID!

### Configuration Options

#### Lightweight View
- Container switches (start/stop)
- Restart buttons
- Status sensors
- CPU and memory monitoring
- Uptime tracking
- Stack controls

#### Full View
- All Lightweight features

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Components
- **PortainerAPI**: Main API facade with automatic SSL handling
- **DataUpdateCoordinator**: Centralized data management and caching
- **Modular API Classes**: Specialized classes for containers, stacks, and images
- **Base Entities**: Reusable entity classes with common functionality

### Device Hierarchy
```
Portainer Endpoint
├── Stack: my-app
│   ├── Container: web (switch, sensors, buttons)
│   ├── Container: db (switch, sensors, buttons)
│   └── Stack Controls (start, stop, update)
└── Standalone Container: monitoring (switch, sensors, buttons)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Endpoint 404 Error
```
❌ Endpoint 1 not found (404)
```
**Solution**: Check your Portainer → Endpoints to find the correct endpoint ID.

#### SSL Certificate Errors
```
ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: certificate verify failed
```
**Solution**: The integration automatically handles SSL issues. If problems persist, check your Portainer SSL configuration.

#### Logger Configuration Error
```
Invalid config for 'logger': 'custom_components.ha_portainer_link' is an invalid option
```
**Solution**: Use the proper logs mapping in your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.ha_portainer_link: info
```

#### Container State Not Updating
**Solution**: The integration automatically refreshes data. If issues persist, use the refresh service:
```yaml
service: ha_portainer_link.refresh
```

#### Stack Update Process
**Note**: Stack updates now perform a comprehensive process:
1. Retrieves stack file content (docker-compose.yml) and environment variables
2. Stops all containers in the stack
3. Deletes existing containers to force recreation
4. Redeploys the stack with fresh images and current compose settings
5. Waits for containers to be running with configurable timeout
6. Includes robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
7. Provides detailed progress reporting and debugging information

### Debugging
Enable debug logging in your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.ha_portainer_link: debug
```

## 🛠️ Services

### Available Services

#### `ha_portainer_link.reload`
Reload all Portainer integrations.

#### `ha_portainer_link.refresh`
